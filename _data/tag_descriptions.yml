    I'm aiming to post technical notes on my website, as a kind of "side project". They are based on papers I've read, courses I've taken, etc. There are a few reasons: Mostly, I'm organizing my thoughts and keeping references for my future self. I'm also trying to explore context for technical results, and note (and resolve, if possible) any questions that come up for me. My goal is to avoid formal proofs, but I apologize because the posts are still becoming quite long!
