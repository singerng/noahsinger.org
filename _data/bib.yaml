  title: Minimum circuit size, graph isomorphism, and related problems
  type: article-journal
  volume: '47'

- id: AHM+08
  abstract: >-
    For circuit classes $R$, the fundamental computational problem Min-R asks
    for the minimum $R$-size of a Boolean function presented as a truth table.
    Prominent examples of this problem include Min-DNF, which asks whether a
    given Boolean function presented as a truth table has a $k$-term disjunctive
    normal form (DNF), and Min-Circuit (also called the minimum circuit size
    problem (MCSP)), which asks whether a Boolean function presented as a truth
    table has a size $k$ Boolean circuit. We present a new reduction proving
    that Min-DNF is NP-complete. It is significantly simpler than the known
    reduction of Masek Some NP-Complete Set Covering Problems, manuscript,
    1979], which is from Circuit-SAT. We then give a more complex reduction,
    yielding the result that Min-DNF cannot be approximated to within a factor
    smaller than $(\log N)^{\gamma}$, for some constant $\gamma>0$, assuming
    that NP is not contained in quasi-polynomial time. The standard greedy
    algorithm for Set Cover is often used in practice to approximate Min-DNF.
    The question of whether Min-DNF can be approximated to within a factor of
    $o(\log N)$ remains open, but we construct an instance of Min-DNF on which
    the solution produced by the greedy algorithm is $\Omega(\log N)$ larger
    than optimal. Finally, we turn to the question of approximating circuit size
    for slightly more general classes of circuits. DNF formulas are depth-two
    circuits of AND and OR gates. Depth-$d$ circuits are denoted by $AC^0_d$. We
    show that it is hard to approximate the size of $AC^0_d$ circuits (for large
    enough $d$) under cryptographic assumptions.

    Several problems in digital logic can be conveniently approached in the
    spectral domain. In this paper we show that the Walsh spectrum of Boolean
    functions can be analyzed by looking at algebraic properties of a class of
    Cayley graphs associated with Boolean functions. We use this idea to
    investigate the Walsh spectrum of certain special functions.

We show it has polynomially large randomized bounded-error communication complexity of Ω(√\n              n\n              ). This yields the first exponential gap between the logarithm of the approximate rank and randomized communication complexity for total functions. Thus,\n              F\n              witnesses a refutation of the log-approximate-rank conjecture that was posed by Lee and Shraibman as a very natural analogue for randomized communication of the still unresolved log-rank conjecture for deterministic communication. The best known previous gap for any total function between the two measures is a recent 4th-power separation by Göös et al.\n            \n            \n              Additionally, our function\n              F\n              refutes Grolmusz’s conjecture\_and a variant of the log-approximate-nonnegative-rank conjecture suggested recently by Kol et\_al., both of which are implied by the log-approximate-rank conjecture. The complement of\n              F\n              has exponentially large approximate nonnegative rank. This answers a question of Lee [32], showing that approximate nonnegative rank can be exponentially larger than approximate rank. The inner function\n              F\n              also falsifies a conjecture about parity measures of Boolean functions made by Tsang et al. The latter conjecture implied the log-rank conjecture for XOR functions.\n            \n            \n              We are pleased to note that shortly after we published our results, two independent groups of researchers, Anshu et al. and Sinha and de Wolf, used our function\n              F\n              to prove that the quantum-log-rank conjecture is also false by showing that\n              F\n              has Ω(\n              n\n              1/6\n              ) quantum communication complexity."

    We introduce the following model for generating .semi-random 3CNF formulas.
    First, an adversary is allowed to pick an arbitrary formula with n varialdes
    and in clauses. Then, the formula is slightly perturbed at random. Namely,
    the smoothing operation leaves the variables of the formula unchanged, but
    flips the polarity of every variable occurrence in the formula independently
    with probability a. If the density m/n of a 3CNF formula exceeds a certain
    threshold value (say, 5epsiv-3) then the smoothing operation almost surely
    results in a non-satisfiable formula. We present a randomized polynomial
    time refutation algorithm that for every sufficiently dense 3CNF formula
    manages to refute most of its smoothed instantiations. The density
    requirement for our refutation algorithm is roughly epsiv-2 radic(n log log
    n), which almost matches the density Omega( radicn) required bv known
    algorithms for refuting 3CNF formulas that are completely random.

    We show that every set of m cn√n log log n vectors in {0, 1}n in which every
    vector has Hamming weight 3 contains a subset of O(log n) vectors that form
    a linear dependency. Our proof is based on showing that in every graph of
    average degree at least c log log n, every legal edge coloring produces a
    cycle in which one of the colors appears either once or twice. (In both
    results, c is some constant.) The results proved are used (in a companion
    work) in refutation algorithms for semirandom 3CNF formulas.

    We prove that several measures in communication complexity are equivalent,
    up to polynomial factors in the logarithm of the rank of the associated
    matrix: deterministic communication complexity, randomized communication
    complexity, information cost and zero-communication cost. This shows that in
    order to prove the log-rank conjecture, it suffices to show that low-rank
    matrices have efficient protocols in any of the aforementioned measures.

    Let $f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ be a boolean function. Its associated XOR

    that, up to polynomial factors, the deterministic communication complexity
    of $f_{\oplus}$ is equal to the parity decision tree complexity of $f$. This
    relies on a novel technique of entropy reduction for protocols, combined
    with existing techniques in Fourier analysis and additive combinatorics.

    We prove an average-case depth hierarchy theorem for Boolean circuits over
    the standard basis of AND, OR, and NOT gates. Our hierarchy theorem says
    that for every d ≥ 2, there is an explicit n-variable Boolean function f,
    computed by a linear-size depth-d formula, which is such that any
    depth-(d−1) circuit that agrees with f on (1/2 + on(1)) fraction of all
    inputs must have size exp(nΩ (1/d)). This answers an open question posed by
    Håstad in his Ph.D. thesis (Håstad 1986b).Our average-case depth hierarchy
    theorem implies that the polynomial hierarchy is infinite relative to a
    random oracle with probability 1, confirming a conjecture of Håstad (1986a),
    Cai (1986), and Babai (1987). We also use our result to show that there is
    no “approximate converse” to the results of Linial, Mansour, Nisan (Linial
    et al. 1993) and (Boppana 1997) on the total influence of bounded-depth
    circuits.A key ingredient in our proof is a notion of random projections
    which generalize random restrictions.

    In this article, we show several results obtained by combining the use of
    stable distributions with pseudorandom generators for bounded space. In
    particular:—We show that, for any p ∈ (0, 2], one can maintain (using only
    O(log n/ϵ2) words of storage) a sketch C(q) of a point q ∈ lnp under dynamic
    updates of its coordinates. The sketch has the property that, given C(q) and
    C(s), one can estimate ‖q − s‖p up to a factor of (1 + ϵ) with large
    probability. This solves the main open problem of Feigenbaum et al.
    [1999].—We show that the aforementioned sketching approach directly
    translates into an approximate algorithm that, for a fixed linear mapping A,
    and given x ∈ ℜn and y ∈ ℜm, estimates ‖Ax − y‖p in O(n + m) time, for any p
    ∈ (0, 2]. This generalizes an earlier algorithm of Wasserman and Blum [1997]
    which worked for the case p = 2.—We obtain another sketch function C′ which
    probabilistically embeds ln1 into a normed space lm1. The embedding
    guarantees that, if we set m = log(1/δ)O(1/ϵ), then for any pair of points
    q, s ∈ ln1, the distance between q and s does not increase by more than (1 +
    ϵ) with constant probability, and it does not decrease by more than (1 − ϵ)
    with probability 1 − δ. This is the only known dimensionality reduction
    theorem for the l1 norm. In fact, stronger theorems of this type (i.e., that
    guarantee very low probability of expansion as well as of contraction)
    cannot exist [Brinkman and Charikar 2003].—We give an explicit embedding of
    ln2 into lnO(log n)1 with distortion (1 + 1/nΘ(1)).

    Boolean circuit complexity is the combinatorics of computer science and
    involves many intriguing problems that are easy to state and explain, even
    for the layman. This book is a comprehensive description of basic lower
    bound arguments, covering many of the gems of this complexity Waterloo that
    have been discovered over the past several decades, right up to results from
    the last year or two. Many open problems, marked as Research Problems, are
    mentioned along the way. The problems are mainly of combinatorial flavor but
    their solutions could have great consequences in circuit complexity and
    computer science. The book will be of interest to graduate students and
    researchers in the fields of computer science and discrete mathematics.

    One of the earliest results in Combinatorics is Mantel's theorem from 1907
    that the largest triangle-free graph on a given vertex set is complete
    bipartite. However, a seemingly similar question posed by Turán in 1941 is
    still open: what is the largest 3-uniform hypergraph on a given vertex set
    with no tetrahedron? This question can be considered a test case for the
    general hypergraph Turán problem, where given an r-uniform hypergraph F, we
    want to determine the maximum number of edges in an r-uniform hypergraph on
    n vertices that does not contain a copy of F. To date there are very few
    results on this problem, even asymptotically. However, recent years have
    seen a revitalisation of this field, via significant developments in the
    available methods, notably the use of stability (approximate structure) and
    flag algebras. This article surveys the known results and methods, and
    discusses some open problems.AcknowledgementsResearch supported in part by
    ERC grant 239696 and EPSRC grant EP/G056730/1. Thanks to Dan Hefetz, Dhruv
    Mubayi, Richard Mycroft and Oleg Pikhurko for helpful comments and
    corrections.IntroductionThe Turán number ex(n, F) is the maximum number of
    edges in an F-free r-graph on n vertices. It is a long-standing open problem
    in Extremal Combinatorics to develop some understanding of these numbers for
    general r-graphs F. Ideally, one would like to compute them exactly, but
    even asymptotic results are currently only known in certain cases. For
    ordinary graphs (r = 2) the picture is fairly complete.

    Let f: {0, 1}n → {0, 1} be a boolean function, and let f∧(x, y) = f(x ∧ y)
    denote the AND-function of f, where x ∧ y denotes bit-wise AND. We study the
    deterministic communication complexity of f∧ and show that, up to a logn
    factor, it is bounded by a polynomial in the logarithm of the real rank of
    the communication matrix of f∧. This comes within a logn factor of
    establishing the log-rank conjecture for AND-functions with no assumptions
    on f. Our result stands in contrast with previous results on special cases
    of the log-rank conjecture, which needed significant restrictions on f such
    as monotonicity or low F2-degree. Our techniques can also be used to prove
    (within a logn factor) a lifting theorem for AND-functions, stating that the
    deterministic communication complexity of f∧ is polynomially related to the
    AND-decision tree complexity of f. The results rely on a new structural
    result regarding boolean functions f: {0, 1}n → {0, 1} with a sparse
    polynomial representation, which may be of independent interest. We show
    that if the polynomial computing f has few monomials then the set system of
    the monomials has a small hitting set, of size poly-logarithmic in its
    sparsity. We also establish extensions of this result to multi-linear
    polynomials f: {0, 1}n → with a larger range.

    We consider the following norm ∥ƒ for Boolean functions

    M(ƒ

    x,y=

    1 if ƒ(x,y)=1

    −1 if ƒ(x,y)=0.

    Further, we refer to the usual product of real matrices and vectors and
    denote by

    ¦v¦ the Euclidean norm of real vectors

    v. In this paper it will be shown by geometric arguments that for each
    function

    ƒ: {0,1}

    n × {0,1}

    n → {0,1}

    .

    - The number of edges of any threshold circuit of depth two computing ƒ
    cannot be smaller than

    n−1

    ‖ƒ‖

    These results yield better lower bounds on probabilistic communication
    complexity as well as on the complexity of threshold circuits of depth two.
    Further, characterizing ∥ƒ∥ by the eigenvalues of

    M(ƒ

    ∗)

    we obtain a method to construct iteratively functions which are hard to
    compute in the above models. This implies lower bounds for decision problems
    that previous probabilistic techniques from Yao (1983), Halstenberg and
    Reischuk (1988) and Hajnal et al. (1987) cannot be applied to.

    In this paper we describe a new method for proving lower bounds on the
    complexity of VLSI - computations and more generally distributed
    computations. Lipton and Sedgewick observed that the crossing sequence
    arguments used to prove lower bounds in VLSI (or TM or distributed
    computing) apply to (accepting) nondeterministic computations as well as to
    deterministic computations. Hence whenever a boolean function f is such that
    f and f (the complement of f, f = 1 - f) have efficient nondeterministic
    chips then the known techniques are of no help for proving lower bounds on
    the complexity of deterministic chips.In this paper we describe a lower
    bound technique (Thm 1) which only applies to deterministic computations

    The log-rank conjecture in communication complexity suggests that the
    deterministic communication complexity of any Boolean rank-r function is
    bounded by polylog(r). Recently, major progress was made by Lovett who
    proved that the communication complexity is bounded by O(r^1/2 * log r).
    Lovett's proof is based on known estimates on the discrepancy of low-rank
    matrices. We give a simple, direct proof based on a hyperplane rounding
    argument that in our opinion sheds more light on the reason why a root
    factor suffices and what is necessary to improve on this factor.

    We study Boolean functions with sparse Fourier spectrum or small spectral
    norm, and show their applications to the Log-rank Conjecture for XOR
    functions f(x ⊕ y) - a fairly large class of functions including well
    studied ones such as Equality and Hamming Distance. The rank of the
    communication matrix Mf for such functions is exactly the Fourier sparsity
    of f. Let d = deg2(f) be the F2-degree of f and DCC(f · ⊕) stand for the
    deterministic communication complexity for f(x ⊕ y). We show that 1) DCC(f ·
    ⊕) = O(2d2/2 logd-2 ∥f̂∥1). In particular, the Log-rank conjecture holds for
    XOR functions with constant F2-degree. 2) DCC(f · ⊕) = O(d∥f̂∥1) =
    O(√(rank(Mf))). This improves the (trivial) linear bound by nearly a
    quadratic factor. We obtain our results through a degree-reduction protocol
    based on a variant of polynomial rank, and actually conjecture that the
    communication cost of our protocol is at most logO(1) rank(Mf). The above
    bounds are obtained from different analysis for the number of parity queries
    required to reduce f's F2-degree. Our bounds also hold for the parity
    decision tree complexity of f, a measure that is no less than the
    communication complexity. Along the way we also prove several structural
    results about Boolean functions with small Fourier sparsity ∥f̂∥0 or
    spectral norm ∥f̂∥1, which could be of independent interest. For functions f
    with constant F2-degree, we show that: 1) f can be written as the summation
    of quasi-polynomially many indicator functions of subspaces with ±-signs,
    improving the previous doubly exponential upper bound by Green and Sanders;
    2) being sparse in Fourier domain is polynomially equivalent to having a
    small parity decision tree complexity; and 3) f depends only on polylog∥f̂∥1
    linear functions of input variables. For functions f with small spectral
    norm, we show that: 1) there is an affine subspace of co dimension ∥f̂∥1 on
    which f(x) is a constant, and 2) there is a parity decision ∥f̂∥1log∥f̂∥0
    for computing f.

    Many combinatorial optimization problems call for the optimization of a
    linear function over a certain polytope. Typically, these polytopes have an
    exponential number of facets. We explore the problem of finding small linear
    programming formulations when one may use any new variables and constraints.
    We show that expressing the matching and the Traveling Salesman Problem by a
    symmetric linear program requires exponential size. We relate the minimum
    size needed by a LP to express a polytope to a combinatorial parameter,
    point out some connections with communication complexity theory, and examine
    the vertex packing polytope for some classes of graphs.

    The purpose of this paper is to resolve several open problems in the current
    literature on Boolean circuits, communication complexity, and hashing
    functions. These lower bound results share the common feature that their
    proofs utilize probabilistic arguments in an essential way. Specifically, we
    prove that, to compute the majority function of n Boolean variables, the
    size of any depth-3 monotone circuit must be greater than 2nε, and the size
    of any width-2 branching program must have super-polynomial growth. We also
    show that, for the problem of deciding whether i ≤ j for two n-bit integers
    i and j, the probabilistic ε-error one-way communication complexity is of
    order θ(n), while the two-way ε-error complexity is O((log n)2). We will
    also prove that, to compute i · j mod p for an n-bit prime p, the
    probabilistic ε-error two-way communication complexity is of order θ(n).
    Finally, we prove a conjecture of Ullman that uniform hashing is
    asymptotically optimal in its expected retrieval cost among open address
    hashing schemes.

    We show that for any Boolean function f: {0, 1}n → {0, 1}, the bounded-error
    quantum communication complexity Qε(f (f o ⊕) of XOR functions f(x ⊕ y)
    satisfies that [EQUATION] where d = deg2(f) is the F2-degree of f, and
    [EQUATION]. This implies that the previous lower bound [EQUATION] by Lee and
    Shraibman [LS09] is tight for f with low F2-degree. The result also confirms
    the quantum version of the Log-rank Conjecture for low-degree XOR functions.
    In addition, we show that the exact quantum communication complexity
    satisfies [EQUATION] where ||f||0 is the number of nonzero Fourier
    coefficients of f. This matches the previous lower bound QE(f(x, y)) = Ω(log
    rank(Mf)) by Buhrman and de Wolf [BdW01] for low-degree XOR functions.
