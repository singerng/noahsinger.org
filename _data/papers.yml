    A <em>Boolean maximum constraint satisfaction problem</em>, Max-CSP(\(f\)), is a maximization problem specified
    by a constraint function \(f:\{-1,1\}^k\to\{0,1\}\). An instance of Max-CSP(\(f\)) consists of \(n\) variables
    and \(m\) constraints, where each constraint is \(f\) applied on a tuple of "literals" of \(k\) distinct
    variables chosen from the \(n\) variables. \(f\) is said to be <em>symmetric</em> if \(f(x)\) depends only on
    \(\sum_{i=1}^k x_i\), where \(x=(x_1,\dots,x_k)\). Chou, Golovnev, and Velusamy [CGV20, FOCS 2020] obtained explicit
    constants characterizing the <em>streaming</em> approximability of all symmetric Max-\(2\)CSPs.
    More recently, Chou, Golovnev, Sudan, and Velusamy [CGSV21, FOCS] proved a general dichotomy 
    theorem showing tight approximability of Boolean Max-CSPs with respect to <em>sketching</em> algorithms.
    For every \(f\), they showed that there exists an optimal approximation ratio \(\alpha(f)\in (0,1]\) such
    that for every \(\epsilon>0\), Max-CSP(\(f\)) is \((\alpha(f)-\epsilon)\)-approximable by a <em>linear</em> sketching
    algorithm in \(O(\log n)\) space, but any \((\alpha(f)+\epsilon)\)-approximation sketching algorithm for
    Max-CSP(\(f\)) requires \(\Omega(\sqrt{n})\) space. While they show that \(\alpha(f)\) is computable to arbitrary
    precision in \(\mathbf{PSPACE}\), they do not give a closed-form expression.
     
    In this work, we build on the [CSGV21] dichotomy theorem and give <mark>closed-form expressions
    for the sketching approximation ratios of multiple families of symmetric Boolean functions</mark>. These include
    \(k\mathsf{AND}\) and \(\mathsf{Th}_k^{k-1}\) (the ``weight-at-least-\((k-1)\)'' threshold function on \(k\) variables). In particular,
    letting \(\alpha'_k = 2^{-(k-1)} (1-k^{-2})^{(k-1)/2}\), we show that for odd \(k \geq 3\), \(\alpha(k\mathsf{AND}) = \alpha'_k\); 
    for even \(k \geq 2\), \(\alpha(k\mathsf{AND}) = 2\alpha'_{k+1}\); and for even \(k \geq 2\),
    \(\alpha(\mathsf{Th}_k^{k-1}) = \frac{k}2\alpha'_{k-1}\). We also resolve the ratio for the ``weight-exactly-\(\frac{k+1}2\)''
    function for odd \(k \in \{3,\ldots,51\}\) as well as fifteen other functions. We stress here that the
    closed-form expressions need not have existed just given the [CGSV21] dichotomy, and our
    analysis involves identifying structural "saddle-point" properties of the dichotomy. <mark>For arbitrary
    <em>threshold</em> functions, we also give optimal "bias-based" approximation algorithms generalizing
    [CGV20] while simplifying [CGSV21].</mark> Finally, we investigate the <em>streaming</em> lower
    bounds in [CGSV21]. <mark>We show that for \(\mathsf{Th}^3_4\), the [CGSV21] streaming and
    sketching lower bounds match (previously only known for \(2\mathsf{AND}\)), while for \(3\mathsf{AND}\), their streaming
    lower bound is provably weaker.</mark>

    An <em>ordering constraint satisfaction problem (OCSP)</em> is given by a positive integer \(k\) and a
    constraint predicate \(\Pi\) mapping permutations on \(\{1,\ldots,k\}\) to \(\{0,1\}\). Given an
    instance of OCSP\((\Pi)\) on \(n\) variables and \(m\) constraints, the goal is to find an
    ordering of the \(n\) variables that maximizes the number of constraints that are satisfied,
    where a constraint specifies a sequence of \(k\) distinct variables and the constraint is satisfied
    by an ordering on the \(n\) variables if the ordering induced on the \(k\) variables in the
    constraint satisfies \(\Pi\). Ordering constraint satisfaction problems capture natural problems
    including "Maximum acyclic subgraph (MAS)" and "Betweenness".<br/>

    In this work we consider the task of approximating the maximum number of satisfiable constraints
    in the (single-pass) streaming setting, where an instance is presented as a stream of
    constraints. <mark>We show that for every \(\Pi\), OCSP\((\Pi)\) is approximation-resistant to
    \(o(n)\)-space streaming algorithms, i.e., algorithms using \(o(n)\) space cannot distinguish streams
    where almost every constraint is satisfiable from streams where no ordering beats the
    random ordering by a noticeable amount. This space bound is tight up to
    polylogarithmic factors.</mark> In the case of MAS, our result shows that for every
    \(\epsilon>0\), MAS is not \((1/2+\epsilon)\)-approximable in \(o(n)\) space. The previous best
    inapproximability result, due to Guruswami and Tao [APPROX 2019],
    only ruled out a \(3/4\)-approximation in \(o(\sqrt n)\) space.<br/>

    Our results build on recent works of Chou, Golovnev, Sudan, Velingker, and Velusamy who show
    tight, linear-space inapproximability results for a broad class of (non-ordering)
    constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) over arbitrary (finite) alphabets. Our results are
    obtained by building a family of appropriate CSPs from any given OCSP, and applying their
    work to this family of CSPs. To convert the resulting hardness results for CSPs back to our OCSP, 
    we show that the hard instances from this earlier work have the following "small-set expansion" property:
    If the CSP instance is viewed as a hypergraph in the natural way, then for every partition
    of the hypergraph into small blocks most of the hyperedges are incident on vertices from
    distinct blocks. By exploiting this combinatorial property, in combination with the hardness
    results of the resulting families of CSPs, we give optimal inapproximability results for all OCSPs.

    We study the log-rank conjecture from the perspective of point-hyperplane incidence geometry.
    We formulate the following conjecture: Given a point set in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) that is covered by
    constant-sized sets of parallel hyperplanes, there exists an affine subspace that
    accounts for a large (i.e., \(2^{-{\operatorname{polylog}(d)}}\) fraction of the incidences, in the
    sense of containing a large fraction of the points and being contained in a large fraction
    of the hyperplanes. (In other words, the point-hyperplane incidence graph for such configurations
    has a large complete bipartite subgraph.) Alternatively, our conjecture may be interpreted
    linear-algebraically as follows: Any rank-\(d\) matrix containing at most \(O(1)\) distinct entries
    in each column contains a submatrix of fractional size \(2^{-{\operatorname{polylog}(d)}}\), in which each
    column contains one distinct entry. We prove that our conjecture is equivalent to the log-rank
    conjecture; the crucial ingredient of this proof is a reduction from bounds for parallel
    \(k\)-partitions to bounds for parallel \((k-1)\)-partitions. We also introduce an (apparent)
    strengthening of the conjecture, which relaxes the requirements that the sets of hyperplanes be parallel.<br/>

    Motivated by the connections above, we revisit well-studied questions in point-hyperplane
    incidence geometry <em>without</em> structural assumptions (i.e., the existence of partitions),
    and  in particular, we initiate the study of complete bipartite subgraph size in incidence graphs
    in the regime where dimension is not a constant. We give an elementary argument for the existence
    of complete bipartite subgraphs of density \(\Omega(\epsilon^{2d}/d)\) in any \(d\)-dimensional
    configuration with incidence density \(\epsilon\) (qualitatively matching previous results, which had
    implicit dimension-dependent constants and required sophisticated incidence-geometric techniques).
    We also improve an upper-bound construction of Apfelbaum and Sharir [<em>SIAM J. Discrete Math.</em> 2007],
    yielding a configuration whose complete bipartite subgraphs are exponentially small and
    whose incidence density is \(\Omega(1/\sqrt d)\). Finally, we discuss various constructions
    (due to others) of products of Boolean matrices which yield configurations with incidence
    density \(\Omega(1)\) and bipartite subgraph density \(2^{-\Omega(\sqrt d)}\), and pose several
    questions for this special case in the alternative language of extremal set combinatorics.<br/>

    Our framework and results may help shed light on the difficulty of improving Lovett's
    \(\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\operatorname{rank}(f)})\) bound [<em>J. ACM</em> 2016] for the log-rank conjecture; in particular,
    any improvement on this bound would imply the first bipartite subgraph size bounds for
    parallel \(3\)-partitioned configurations which beat our generic bounds for unstructured configurations.
