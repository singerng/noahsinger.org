    An <em>ordering constraint satisfaction problem (OCSP)</em> is given by a positive integer \(k\) and a constraint predicate
    \(\Pi\) mapping permutations on \(\{1,\ldots,k\}\) to \((0,1)\). Given an instance of OCSP(\(\Pi\)) on \(n\) variables
    and \(m\) constraints, the goal is to find an ordering of the \(n\) variables that maximizes the number of constraints
    that are satisfied, where a constraint specifies a sequence of \(k\) distinct variables and the constraint is <em>satisfied</em>
    by an ordering on the \(n\) variables if the ordering induced on the \(k\) variables in the constraint satisfies \(\Pi\).
    Natural ordering constraint satisfaction problems include "Maximum acyclic subgraph (MAS)" and "Betweenness".


    In this work we consider the task of approximating the maximum number of satisfiable constraints in the <em>(single-pass)
    streaming setting</em>, where an instance is presented as a stream of constraints. <mark>We show that for every \(\Pi\), algorithms
    using \(o(\sqrt n)\) space cannot distinguish streams where almost every constraint is satisfiable from streams
    where no ordering beats the random ordering by a noticeable amount.</mark> In the case of MAS our result shows that for
    every \(\epsilon>0\), MAS is not \((\frac12+\epsilon)\)-approximable. The previous best inapproximability result only
    ruled out a \(\frac34\)-approximation.
    

    Our results build on a recent work of Chou, Golovnev, Sudan, and Velusamy who show tight inapproximability results
    for some constraint satisfaction problems over arbitrary (finite) alphabets. We show that the hard instances from
    this earlier work have the property that in every partition of the hypergraph formed by the constraints into small
    blocks, most of the hyperedges are incident on vertices from distinct blocks. By exploiting this combinatorial property,
    in combination with a natural reduction from CSPs over large finite alphabets to OCSPs, we give optimal
    inapproximability results for all OCSPs.

    We study the log-rank conjecture from the perspective of incidence geometry and present a reformulation as well as a
    strengthening. The reformulation involves point sets in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) that are covered in many ways by constant-sized
    sets of parallel hyperplanes. We show that the log-rank conjecture is equivalent to the implication that all such configurations
    contain a subspace that accounts for a large fraction of the incidences, in the sense of containing a large fraction of
    the points and being contained in a large fraction of the hyperplanes. In other words the log-rank conjecture is equivalent
    to asserting that the point-hyperplane incidence graph for such configurations has a large complete bipartite subgraph.
    The strengthening of the log-rank conjecture comes from relaxing the requirements that the set of hyperplanes be parallel. 


    Motivated by the connections above we revisit some well-studied questions in point-hyperplane incidence geometry and present
    some improvements. We give a simple probabilistic argument for the existence of complete bipartite subgraphs of density
    \(\Omega(\epsilon^{2d}/d)\) in any \(d\)-dimensional configuration with incidence density \(\epsilon\), matching previously
    known results qualitatively. We also improve an upper-bound construction of Apfelbaum and Sharir, yielding a configuration
    whose complete bipartite subgraphs are exponentially small and whose incidence density is \(\Omega(1/\sqrt{d})\).
