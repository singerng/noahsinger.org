    An <em>ordering constraint satisfaction problem (OCSP)</em> is given by a positive integer \(k\) and a
    constraint predicate \(\Pi\) mapping permutations on \(\{1,\ldots,k\}\) to \(\{0,1\}\). Given an
    instance of OCSP\((\Pi)\) on \(n\) variables and \(m\) constraints, the goal is to find an
    ordering of the \(n\) variables that maximizes the number of constraints that are satisfied,
    where a constraint specifies a sequence of \(k\) distinct variables and the constraint is satisfied
    by an ordering on the \(n\) variables if the ordering induced on the \(k\) variables in the
    constraint satisfies \(\Pi\). Ordering constraint satisfaction problems capture natural problems
    including "Maximum acyclic subgraph (MAS)" and "Betweenness".<br/>

    In this work we consider the task of approximating the maximum number of satisfiable constraints
    in the (single-pass) streaming setting, where an instance is presented as a stream of
    constraints. <mark>We show that for every \(\Pi\), OCSP\((\Pi)\) is approximation-resistant to
    \(o(n)\)-space streaming algorithms, i.e., algorithms using \(o(n)\) space cannot distinguish streams
    where almost every constraint is satisfiable from streams where no ordering beats the
    random ordering by a noticeable amount. This space bound is tight up to
    polylogarithmic factors.</mark> In the case of MAS, our result shows that for every
    \(\epsilon>0\), MAS is not \((1/2+\epsilon)\)-approximable in \(o(n)\) space. The previous best
    inapproximability result only ruled out a \(3/4\)-approximation in \(o(\sqrt n)\) space.<br/>

    Our results build on recent works of Chou, Golovnev, Sudan, Velingker, and Velusamy who show
    tight, linear-space inapproximability results for a broad class of (non-ordering)
    constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) over arbitrary (finite) alphabets. Our results are
    obtained by building a family of appropriate CSPs from any given OCSP, and applying their
    work to this family of CSPs. To convert the resulting hardness results for CSPs back to our OCSP, 
    we show that the hard instances from this earlier work have the following "small-set expansion" property:
    If the CSP instance is viewed as a hypergraph in the natural way, then for every partition
    of the hypergraph into small blocks most of the hyperedges are incident on vertices from
    distinct blocks. By exploiting this combinatorial property, in combination with the hardness
    results of the resulting families of CSPs, we give optimal inapproximability results for all OCSPs.

    We study the log-rank conjecture from the perspective of incidence geometry and present a reformulation as well as a
    strengthening. The reformulation involves point sets in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) that are covered in many ways by constant-sized
    sets of parallel hyperplanes. We show that the log-rank conjecture is equivalent to the implication that all such configurations
    contain a subspace that accounts for a large fraction of the incidences, in the sense of containing a large fraction of
    the points and being contained in a large fraction of the hyperplanes. In other words the log-rank conjecture is equivalent
    to asserting that the point-hyperplane incidence graph for such configurations has a large complete bipartite subgraph.
    The strengthening of the log-rank conjecture comes from relaxing the requirements that the set of hyperplanes be parallel. 


    Motivated by the connections above we revisit some well-studied questions in point-hyperplane incidence geometry and present
    some improvements. We give a simple probabilistic argument for the existence of complete bipartite subgraphs of density
    \(\Omega(\epsilon^{2d}/d)\) in any \(d\)-dimensional configuration with incidence density \(\epsilon\), matching previously
    known results qualitatively. We also improve an upper-bound construction of Apfelbaum and Sharir, yielding a configuration
    whose complete bipartite subgraphs are exponentially small and whose incidence density is \(\Omega(1/\sqrt{d})\).
