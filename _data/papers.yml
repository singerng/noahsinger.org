    An <em>ordering constraint satisfaction problem (OCSP)</em> is given by a positive integer \(k\) and a
    constraint predicate \(\Pi\) mapping permutations on \(\{1,\ldots,k\}\) to \(\{0,1\}\). Given an
    instance of OCSP\((\Pi)\) on \(n\) variables and \(m\) constraints, the goal is to find an
    ordering of the \(n\) variables that maximizes the number of constraints that are satisfied,
    where a constraint specifies a sequence of \(k\) distinct variables and the constraint is satisfied
    by an ordering on the \(n\) variables if the ordering induced on the \(k\) variables in the
    constraint satisfies \(\Pi\). Ordering constraint satisfaction problems capture natural problems
    including "Maximum acyclic subgraph (MAS)" and "Betweenness".<br/>

    In this work we consider the task of approximating the maximum number of satisfiable constraints
    in the (single-pass) streaming setting, where an instance is presented as a stream of
    constraints. <mark>We show that for every \(\Pi\), OCSP\((\Pi)\) is approximation-resistant to
    \(o(n)\)-space streaming algorithms, i.e., algorithms using \(o(n)\) space cannot distinguish streams
    where almost every constraint is satisfiable from streams where no ordering beats the
    random ordering by a noticeable amount. This space bound is tight up to
    polylogarithmic factors.</mark> In the case of MAS, our result shows that for every
    \(\epsilon>0\), MAS is not \((1/2+\epsilon)\)-approximable in \(o(n)\) space. The previous best
    inapproximability result (Guruswami and Tao, APPROX 2019) only ruled out a \(3/4\)-approximation
    in \(o(\sqrt n)\) space.<br/>

    Our results build on recent works of Chou, Golovnev, Sudan, Velingker, and Velusamy who show
    tight, linear-space inapproximability results for a broad class of (non-ordering)
    constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) over arbitrary (finite) alphabets. Our results are
    obtained by building a family of appropriate CSPs from any given OCSP, and applying their
    work to this family of CSPs. To convert the resulting hardness results for CSPs back to our OCSP, 
    we show that the hard instances from this earlier work have the following "small-set expansion" property:
    If the CSP instance is viewed as a hypergraph in the natural way, then for every partition
    of the hypergraph into small blocks most of the hyperedges are incident on vertices from
    distinct blocks. By exploiting this combinatorial property, in combination with the hardness
    results of the resulting families of CSPs, we give optimal inapproximability results for all OCSPs.

    We study the log-rank conjecture from the perspective of point-hyperplane incidence geometry.
    We formulate the following conjecture: Given a point set in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) that is covered by
    constant-sized sets of parallel hyperplanes, there exists an affine subspace that
    accounts for a large (i.e., \(2^{-{\operatorname{polylog}(d)}}\) fraction of the incidences, in the
    sense of containing a large fraction of the points and being contained in a large fraction
    of the hyperplanes. (In other words, the point-hyperplane incidence graph for such configurations
    has a large complete bipartite subgraph.) Alternatively, our conjecture may be interpreted
    linear-algebraically as follows: Any rank-\(d\) matrix containing at most \(O(1)\) distinct entries
    in each column contains a submatrix of fractional size \(2^{-{\operatorname{polylog}(d)}}\), in which each
    column contains one distinct entry. We prove that our conjecture is equivalent to the log-rank
    conjecture; the crucial ingredient of this proof is a reduction from bounds for parallel
    \(k\)-partitions to bounds for parallel \((k-1)\)-partitions. We also introduce an (apparent)
    strengthening of the conjecture, which relaxes the requirements that the sets of hyperplanes be parallel.<br/>

    Motivated by the connections above, we revisit well-studied questions in point-hyperplane
    incidence geometry <em>without</em> structural assumptions (i.e., the existence of partitions),
    and  in particular, we initiate the study of complete bipartite subgraph size in incidence graphs
    in the regime where dimension is not a constant. We give an elementary argument for the existence
    of complete bipartite subgraphs of density \(\Omega(\epsilon^{2d}/d)\) in any \(d\)-dimensional
    configuration with incidence density \(\epsilon\) (qualitatively matching previous results, which had
    implicit dimension-dependent constants and required sophisticated incidence-geometric techniques).
    We also improve an upper-bound construction of Apfelbaum and Sharir (SIAM J. Discrete Math. 2007),
    yielding a configuration whose complete bipartite subgraphs are exponentially small and
    whose incidence density is \(\Omega(1/\sqrt d)\). Finally, we discuss various constructions
    (due to others) of products of Boolean matrices which yield configurations with incidence
    density \(\Omega(1)\) and bipartite subgraph density \(2^{-\Omega(\sqrt d)}\), and pose several
    questions for this special case in the alternative language of extremal set combinatorics.<br/>

    Our framework and results may help shed light on the difficulty of improving Lovett's
    \(\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\operatorname{rank}(f)})\) bound (J. ACM 2016) for the log-rank conjecture; in particular,
    any improvement on this bound would imply the first bipartite subgraph size bounds for
    parallel \(3\)-partitioned configurations which beat our generic bounds for unstructured configurations.
