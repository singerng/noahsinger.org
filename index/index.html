    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University. My research interests are in theoretical computer science, and I'm lucky to be advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~praveshk/">Pravesh Kothari</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/aayushjain/home">Aayush Jain</a>. I'm supported by an <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org">NSF GRFP</a> fellowship. For my CV, see <a href="/index/cv.pdf">here</a>, and for a list of my papers, see <a href="/papers">here</a>.</p>

    <p>In Spring 2022, I graduated magna cum laude from Harvard with an A.B. in Computer Science and Math. At Harvard, I was fortunate to be mentored by <a href="https://madhu.seas.harvard.edu">Madhu Sudan</a>, and I was a proud resident of <a href="https://pfoho.harvard.edu">Pforzheimer House</a>.</p>

          <h3>Research Overview</h3>

          <p>I have broad interests throughout complexity and algorithms. Recently, I've been thinking about average-case complexity and combinatorial optimization, with applications to cryptography, coding theory, and combinatorics. Related technical ideas are Sum-of-Squares relaxations, high-dimensional expanders, and various random models.</p>

          <h3>Specific Projects</h3>

          <p>I have ongoing interest in understanding <em>approximations for CSPs in streaming models.</em> I was introduced to the area during my undergrad by <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/santhoshiniv/home">Santhoshini Velusamy</a> and Madhu Sudan. With them and other wonderful collaborators I have several papers on the subject, appearing in APPROX 2021 and 2022, and in submission. This work was also the subject of my <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37371750">undergraduate thesis</a>, which was awarded a <a href="https://prizes.fas.harvard.edu/hoopes-prize">Hoopes Prize</a>.</p>

          <h3>Activities</h3>

          <p><strong>Teaching.</strong>
            At Harvard, I was a teaching assistant for the following courses:
            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~madhusudan/courses/Fall2021/"><em>CS 121: Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science</em> (Fall 2021)</a></li>
              <li><a href="http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~libcs124/cs124/index.html"><em>CS 124: Data Structures and Algorithms</em> (Spring 2021)</a></li>
              <li><a href="http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~madhusudan/courses/Fall2020/"><em>CS 121: Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science</em> (Fall 2020)</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://read.seas.harvard.edu/cs161/2020/"><em>CS 161: Operating Systems</em> (Spring 2020)</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://cs121.boazbarak.org"><em>CS 121: Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science</em> (Fall 2019)</a></li>
            </ul>
          In CS 121 (Fall 2019 and 2020), I organized guest lectures in the "CS 121.5" advanced section.</p>

          <p>In Summer 2022, I was a teaching assistant for the 2022 <a href="https://tcs-summerschool.ttic.edu">New Horizons in TCS</a> program at TTIC. During Fall 2022, I'm volunteering to edit scribe notes for Madhu Sudan's <a href="https://sites.google.com/g.harvard.edu/fall2022itforcs"><em>CS 229R: Information Theory for Computer Science</em></a>.</p>

          <p><strong>Community.</strong> At Harvard, from 2020-2022 I was a CS <a href="https://harvardcs.info/advising/pca/">Peer Concentration Adviser</a> and <a href="https://www.harvardwics.com/mentorships">Women in CS (WiCS) mentor</a>. In Spring 2019, I worked with Harvard's <a href="http://digilit.io/">Digital Literacy Project</a>
            to teach Scratch and Processing.js to Boston-area middle school students.

          <p><strong>Work Experience.</strong>
          In Summer 2019, I worked as a software engineering intern at Airbnb in San Francisco on the Host Growth &amp; Traffic team, where I built a production data pipeline to discover and manage large quantities of Google search advertising keywords targeting Airbnb hosts.</p>

          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          
          <p><strong>Literature.</strong> I love science fiction! My favorite short story is William Gibson's <a href="http://www.lib.ru/GIBSON/frag_rose.txt">Fragments of
            a Hologram Rose</a>. Some of my favorite novels are Gibson's <em>Neuromancer</em>,
            Le Guin's <em>The Dispossessed</em>, Jemisin's <em>The Fifth Season</em>, Robinson's <em>Red Mars</em>, García Márquez' <em>Cien años de soledad</em>, and Murakami's <em>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</em>.</p>

          <p><strong>Music.</strong> I listen to a lot of music, including indie rock, electronica,
            and hip hop; my favorite artists include The Strokes, Ratatat, Gorillaz, and Daft
            Punk. I also play classical piano.</p>

          <p><strong>Podcasts.</strong> I like listening to podcasts, and some of my favorites are
            <a href="https://yourewrongabout.com">You're Wrong About</a>,
            <a href="https://www.maintenancephase.com">Maintenance Phase</a>,
            and <a href="https://www.alieward.com/ologies">Ologies</a>.</p>

          <p><strong>Other.</strong> I love to watch TV shows and listen to podcasts; <a href="/cooking">bake and cook</a>; play tennis and go on long walks; and watch hockey (go Caps!) and basketball.</p>
