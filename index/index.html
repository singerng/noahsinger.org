    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University. My research interests are in theoretical computer science, and I'm lucky to be advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~praveshk/">Pravesh Kothari</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/aayushjain/home">Aayush Jain</a>. I'm supported by an <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org">NSF GRFP</a> fellowship. For my CV, see <a href="/index/cv.pdf">here</a>, and for a list of my papers, see <a href="/papers">here</a>.</p>

    <p>In Spring 2022, I graduated magna cum laude from Harvard with an A.B. in Computer Science and Math. At Harvard, I was fortunate to be mentored by <a href="https://madhu.seas.harvard.edu">Madhu Sudan</a>, and I was a proud resident of <a href="https://pfoho.harvard.edu">Pforzheimer House</a>.</p>

    <p><em>In Fall 2023, I am helping organize a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PBddwr6dMlV5Cl93Ghq1CPrqcg8wWZS1KQBvxfygGfM/edit">reading group on high-dimensional expanders</a> at CMU.</em></p>

          <h3>Research Overview</h3>

          <p>I have broad interests throughout complexity and algorithms, centered around combinatorial optimization and average-case complexity, with applications to combinatorics and cryptography.</p>
  
          <p>One of my projects is understanding the <em>approximability</em> of <em>constraint satisfaction problems</em> in <em>streaming</em> and <em>sublinear models</em>. I was introduced to these questions during my undergrad by <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/santhoshiniv/home">Santhoshini Velusamy</a> and Madhu Sudan, and with them and other wonderful collaborators we have several papers, appearing in APPROX 2021, 2022, and 2023, SODA 2023, and FOCS 2023. The first few of these works were the subject of my <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37371750">undergraduate thesis</a>, which was awarded a <a href="https://prizes.fas.harvard.edu/hoopes-prize">Hoopes Prize</a> at Harvard. See also my recent talk on <a href="https://youtu.be/pOXRMNNBO3c">streaming DICUT algorithms</a> at CMU Theory Lunch.</p>

          <h3>Teaching</h3>

          <p>In Fall 2023, I am a teaching assistant for <em>15-459: Undergraduate Quantum Computation</em> at CMU, taught by Ryan O'Donnell.</p>

          <p>
            At Harvard, I was a teaching assistant for the following courses:
            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~madhusudan/courses/Fall2021/"><em>CS 121: Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science</em> (Fall 2021)</a></li>
              <li><a href="http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~libcs124/cs124/index.html"><em>CS 124: Data Structures and Algorithms</em> (Spring 2021)</a></li>
              <li><a href="http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~madhusudan/courses/Fall2020/"><em>CS 121: Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science</em> (Fall 2020)</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://read.seas.harvard.edu/cs161/2020/"><em>CS 161: Operating Systems</em> (Spring 2020)</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://cs121.boazbarak.org"><em>CS 121: Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science</em> (Fall 2019)</a></li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          
          <p>In CS 121 (Fall 2019 and 2020), I organized guest lectures in the "CS 121.5" advanced section. In Summer 2022, I was a teaching assistant for the 2022 <a href="https://tcs-summerschool.ttic.edu">New Horizons in TCS</a> program at TTIC.</p>

          <h3>Hobbies</h3>

          <p>I love to read; play piano; listen to music and podcasts; watch TV; bake and cook (photos <a href="/cooking">here</a>); play tennis; go on long walks; and watch hockey (go Caps!) and basketball. See some of my favorite books, TV shows, and musicians <a href="/faves">here</a>.</p>

          <h3>Miscellanea</h3>

          <p>Before college, I helped found an online high school cybersecurity competition called <a href="https://angstromctf.com">Ã¥ngstromCTF</a> (running since 2016!), and redesigned our school newspaper website <a href="https://silverchips.mbhs.edu">SilverChips Online</a>.</p>

          <p>My brother <a href="https://ethansinger.me">Ethan</a> studies statistics and public policy.</p>
